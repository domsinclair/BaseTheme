This is a simple starter project based on Tailwind CSS which can be used as a base for Pinegrow projects ensuring that you get the latest version of Tailwind that may not be directly supported by Pinegrow as yet..

At the time of creation Tailwind css was at version 3.2.1  Tailwind may well have been updated since then so run the following command at the command prompt before using the project template.

```
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest \
  @tailwindcss/typography@latest \
  postcss@latest \
  autoprefixer@latest
  ```
